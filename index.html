                Willetton is the perfect example of a classic Perth suburb, offering the
                warmth and safety of a family friendly neighbourhood just 15 kilometres
                from the vibrant hub that is our ever-evolving CBD.
            </p>
            <p>
                The suburb began to flourish in the 1970s and has shown strong, steady
                growth ever since, making it one of Australia’s most consistent suburbs
                for property growth. Given the area’s maturity, you can expect cosy streets
                lined with leafy trees and neighbours comprised of middle income earners
                in established couples and family groups. It’s also a dynamic cultural pocket
                known for its diversity, with 1 in 5 residents hailing from South East Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s hardly surprising that this suburb is in high demand, especially given
                the internationally recognised education facilities in the area, with Nicheliving
                Willetton located within the highly-regarded Willetton Senior High School zone.
                Just look at all that surrounds Willetton:

                    high performing primary and high schools. Nestled directly
                    between Curtin and Murdoch universities, Willetton is also the
                    ideal spot for any seeking tertiary education.
